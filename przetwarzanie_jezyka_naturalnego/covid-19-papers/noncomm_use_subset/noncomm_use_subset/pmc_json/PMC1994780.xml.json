            "text": "Mass spectrometry has much to offer the field of genomic analysis, particularly in terms of multiplexed analysis and accurate quantification. To date, many mass spectrometry-based approaches for genomic analysis have been based on direct detection of nucleic acids particularly using matrix assisted laser desorption ionisation time-of-flight (MALDI TOF) MS analysis. MALDI TOF is well suited to this approach due to the high mass range achievable by TOF analysis, however, MALDI TOF instrumentation is relatively expensive and sample preparation can be quite laborious. In addition, direct analysis of nucleic acids by mass spectrometry suffers from problems such as depurination leading to fragmentation (1) or cation adduct formation (2,3). These issues notwithstanding, MALDI TOF analysis of nucleic acids has been applied to DNA sequencing (4,5), RNA sequencing (6,7), analysis of DNA tandem repeats (8). In particular, PNA probes, with and without non-cleavable mass modifiers, have been used for characterization of genomic DNA libraries (9), detection of DNA methylation (10) and detection of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (11,12) by MALDI TOF mass spectrometry.",

ESI-MS has some advantages over MALDI TOF MS particularly the availability of lower cost instrumentation. Moreover, sample handling can be simpler since most molecular biology assays are carried out in solution and such liquid samples are injected directly into the instrument. Furthermore, very high molecular weight species can be analysed due to the propensity for large molecules, such as PCR products, to form multiply charged ions that have relatively low overall mass-to-charge ratios under electrospray ionisation conditions. However, direct analysis of nucleic acids by ESI-MS still suffers from the same problems as MALDI TOF MS such as cation adduct formation (14). In addition, the multiply charged ion spectra that are generated for large nucleic acid fragments can be very complicated reducing sensitivity and making multiplexing difficult (16).",

Mass spectrometric analysis of mass tags, by ESI or MALDI also offers the possibility of accurate quantification through the use of isotopic tags.

A matrix-free laser desorption approach, which has reduced workup requirements has been demonstrated (21,25) but this still requires that the sample be spotted onto a MALDI target or hybridized to an array. To our knowledge, only one mass tagging approach employing ESI-MS analysis has been demonstrated (26). In this approach, mass tags are photo-cleavably linked to oligonucleotides and tag detection requires a photo-cleavage step and a tag isolation step outside of the mass spectrometer prior to tag detection, i.e. the workup is not much simpler than that required for MALDI TOF analysis.",

The ESI-cleavable TNT\u2013PNA conjugates consist of a PNA probe portion, which interacts with the immobilized target sequence (DNA or RNA) and a peptide tandem nucleic acid mass tag portion, which is ultimately detected. Note that the TNT shown is merely a representation of the tag and not a real structure (Figure 2). An ESI-cleavable linker connects the PNA probe portion of the conjugate to the tandem nucleic acid mass tag peptide. The complete TNT \u2018Parent Tag\u2019 comprises the red \u2018Tag Fragment\u2019 portion and the blue \u2018Mass Normalizer\u2019 portion shown in Figure 1. The TNT marker is designed to have a unique combination of parent tag mass and tag fragment mass, released during collision induced dissociation (CID), and it is this pair of masses that serves as the sequence identifier. In a typical scenario (Figure 1), a set of PNA hybridization probes labelled with different TNTs is first hybridized to the captured target nucleic acids of interest (step (1)). After stringent washes to remove the non-hybridized probes (step (2)), the probes are denatured from the target (step (3)) and injected into an ESI-MS/MS instrument for detection (step (4)). In the mass spectrometer, the TNTs cleave from the PNAs during electrospray ionization (step (5)). The TNT parent tag ions are then selected from the background, fragmented by CID and finally, daughter, tag fragment ions from the fragmentation are detected (step (6)), confirming that the signals are indeed due to the presence of tagged probes, thereby detecting the presence of the target sequences.\n\n",

The TNTs are peptides comprising two parts, the tag fragment portion, which carries a charge due to the presence of a tertiary amino-functionality and the mass normalization portion, which remains essentially uncharged. These two portions of the tag are linked by a cleavage enhancement group, a piperazine ring, which also carries the charge of the tag fragment on its tertiary amino-group. The two tag portions both comprise a mass modifier component, which are isotopes of alanine in this tag although a large number of different mass modifiers could be used. It can be seen from Figure 2 that the two tags shown employ the same mass modifier components but the order differs between the tags. Thus, the overall masses of the tags are the same but the tag fragments have different masses, which are equalized by the mass of the mass normalization portion. These tags are designed so that on analysis by collision-induced dissociation (CID), the tag fragment is released to give rise to a uniquely resolvable ion. Thus, this pair of tags allows a pair of PNA probes to be distinguished by MS/MS analysis. Each tag is linked to a PNA oligonucleotide probe by a second linker, comprising aspartic acid and proline that is easily cleaved by CID (37). As shown in Figure 2, the aspartic acid/proline linker is used to cleave the tags from their oligonucleotides during electrospray ionization of the tagged oligonucleotides. The expected structures and mass-to-charge ratios of the cleaved parent tag ions generated by dissociation of the aspartic acid/proline linkage are shown in part (ii) of figure 2a and b (37). Similarly, the expected structures and mass-to-charge ratios of the tag fragment ions and the structures of the neutral mass normalizer fragments, based on the predictions of the \u2018mobile proton\u2019 model of peptide fragmentation (38,39), are shown in part (iii) of Figure 2a and b.",

The cartridge was then opened and the resin within was loaded into a cartridge suitable for a commercial oligonucleotide synthesizer that supports PNA synthesis (Expedite DNA/PNA synthesizer), allowing the completion of the synthesis of the probe. The completed probe was then cleaved from the resin and deprotected in one step (TFA/cresol) and then purified.

This loss is consistent across every TNT-PNA synthesized with TNT2 and may be an effect of the resin used, which relied on a 4-HydroxyMethyl-Phenoxy Acetic acid (HMPA) linker to the carboxylic acid group of the first amino acid to allow the peptide to be cleaved from the resin at the end of the synthesis. Other resins will be tested in future to avoid the loss of isotope. This has meant that the TNTs synthesized were not completely isobaric as shown in Figure 2. The mass of the singly charged parent tag ion of TNT1 is 388.2 while that of TNT2 is 387.2. For the MS/MS analysis of these tags, both tags could still be selected simultaneously by the first quadrupole of the Q-TOF instrument, as the mass range that is gated is actually about 3 daltons for the default setting of the instrument. It was found that setting the nominal selection mass to 388 daltons facilitated transmission of both ions without significantly favouring the selection of either tag.",

The complete TNT-PNA probe molecules were initially ionized with the cone voltage (an accelerating voltage in the ESI source that can be varied on the micromass instrument to control the levels of collision induced dissociation) set to minimize fragmentation of the whole TNT-PNA probe conjugate ions. The whole molecular ions were selected using the first quadrupole of the instrument and were then subjected to collision induced dissociation at different collision energies. Fragmentation of the complete TNT\u2013PNA conjugate ions was carried out as it allows both the cleavage of the TNT parent tag from the PNA and the cleavage of the tag fragment from the parent tag to be seen simultaneously in the TOF analyser of the Q-TOF instrument thus demonstrating both cleavage processes and their relative efficiencies. Typical results are shown in Figure 4, in which it can be seen that, as the collision energy is increased, the whole TNT-PNA probe ion fragments to release the parent tag ion as the predominant fragmentation product. As the fragmentation energy is increased further, the parent tag ion undergoes subsequent consecutive fragmentation to give the desired daughter fragment ion. As the collision energy increases further, the intensity of the parent tag ion increases. Similarly, the ratio of the daughter ion to parent ion increases more. These results show that the TNT-PNA probe molecules fragment as anticipated with the aspartic acid/proline linkage cleaving more easily than the piperazine linkage. The higher collision energy spectra are quite noisy as these also contain other products from the fragmentation of the TNT-PNA probe molecule, which would not normally be present when the TNT parent tag ions are analysed by themselves.\n",

In this experiment, pairs of TNT-PNA oligonucleotides of different lengths were mixed together in 1:1 concentrations. It might be expected that the larger TNT-PNA probes would fragment somewhat less easily due to their greater size and the consequent ability to dissipate kinetic energy from collisions over many more different modes of vibration. This would mean that the larger probes should be detected with less sensitivity. It turned out that the larger sequences gave slightly more sensitivity with the 16-mer being almost twice as sensitive as the 8-mer in this experiment. This result may reflect the mechanisms of cleavage and detection, which are dependent on protonation of the aspartic acid and the piperazine groups in the tags. The larger probes tend to adopt higher charge states (not shown), i.e. they are more heavily protonated and the availability of more free protons on the larger probe ions may facilitate the cleavage of the tags, masking steric effects. However, only three different size molecules were evaluated, and this will be explored more fully in future.",

Sets of TNT isotopes should have almost identical behaviour in analytical separations (17) and during the ionization process. This means that it should be possible to use these tags to accurately quantify their associated oligonucleotide sequences as the ratios of the intensities of the TNT isotopomer fragments should reflect the ratios of the concentrations of the probes in solution or hybridized on their targets (Figure 5). To demonstrate this feature of the TNT design, various experiments were conducted. In these experiments, pairs of TNT\u2013PNA conjugates are analysed by ESI-MS/MS, where the parent tag ions are cleaved from their probes in the ESI ion source using a cone voltage of 25 V. The cleaved parent tag ions are subsequently selected from background by gating both 387.3 and 388.3 ions with the first quadrupole of the Q-TOF instrument. The gated parent tag ions are then subjected to CID in the second quadrupole of the Q-TOF instrument using a collision energy of 25 V followed by mass separation and detection in the TOF analyser to determine the ratios of the tag pairs. In the first set of experiments, pairs of TNT-PNA oligonucleotide probes of the same length and sequence, but with different tags were mixed in a predefined ratio and diluted to determine how well the ratios are conserved as the concentration of probes is decreased. Results are shown in Figure 6. It can be seen that the ratios of the isotopic TNT-PNA probes are conserved over the range of concentrations investigated.\n",

In the first experiment, external calibration of the quantities of hybridized probes was assessed, i.e. the amount of target in one sample was probed with a TNT-PNA whose abundance was then determined by comparison with a second reference sample comprising a predefined quantity of the duplex of the same target sequence and PNA probe sequence, but with a different TNT isotope conjugated to the probe, after the hybridization. In these studies, aliquots of a synthetic biotinylated 50-mer DNA oligonucleotide target was captured onto avidinated magnetic beads and hybridized with TNT-PNA probes with identical probe sequences but different tags. The hybridized beads were then mixed in different ratios. The target, arbitrarily selected, was a fragment of a sequence from the MOMP gene from Chlamydia pneumoniae. A fixed quantity of one TNT-PNA probe complementary to one of the targets was hybridized to the captured target sequences. The aliquots of beads were then washed extensively to remove probe that had not hybridized. The captured TNT-PNA probe mixture was then eluted into 50:50 water:methanol with 1% formic acid (a solvent suitable for ESI-MS/MS analysis) by thermal denaturation. The eluted TNT-PNA and the spike were then injected directly into the Q-TOF instrument for MS/MS analysis. The ratios of the intensities of the two tags derived from the TNT-PNAs should allow the amount of the target sequences in the pooled samples to be determined. Figure 8 shows the actual correlation between the expected and measured quantities of the target sequences. The results are very similar to the experiments where TNT-PNA probes with the same sequence but different tags are simply mixed together: the measured ratio matches very closely the expected ratio. Negative controls in which the target was absent do not show significant binding of TNT\u2013PNA conjugates to the beads so the probe binding is sequence specific. This gives a clear indication that the probes behave quantitatively in hybridization assays and that TNT-PNA probes can be used for accurate quantification.\n",

This would enable quantification by internal calibration using spiked sequences, housekeeping genes or similar controls in quantitative expression profiling or diagnostic assays. In these experiments, a pair of biotinylated 50-mer target oligonucleotides was used (MOMP-50 again and a sequence from B. anthracis, ANTHRAX-50; see Table 3). These were captured onto streptavidin-coated magnetic beads. The quantity of one target was fixed while the relative quantity of the second was varied. The captured targets were then hybridized at room temperature with a probe solution comprising equal quantities of MOMP-12-TNT1 and Anthrax-12-TNT2 probes (see Table 2). Probes of the same length were used together. After the hybridization, the magnetic beads were washed as before and the hybridized TNT-PNAs were eluted from their targets on the beads into 50:50 methanol:water with 1% formic acid and analysed as described earlier. Typical results are shown in Figure 8. As observed in the simple mixture experiments, the measured TNT ratios show a linear relationship with the expected ratios but the measured quantities do not exactly match the expected ratios when the TNT-PNA probes being compared are not true isotopes but the linear relationship does mean that the measurements are quantitative.

The PNA sequence was extended directly from the peptide TNT. The use of PNA has several advantages for this application: (i) the oligonucleotide and the peptide TNT are generated in a single synthesis on the same resin, which means only a single purification step is required after the synthesis is completed; (ii) PNA is approximately 15% lower in mass than a corresponding DNA sequence, which enhances mass spectrometric sensitivity; (iii) PNA has enhanced binding affinity for its target compared with a corresponding DNA sequence, so a shorter probe can be used to achieve a corresponding level of specificity; (iv) PNA can hybridize under low salt conditions, which is more favourable for ESI analysis of samples as ESI-MS is susceptible to signal suppression by high salt concentrations.",
