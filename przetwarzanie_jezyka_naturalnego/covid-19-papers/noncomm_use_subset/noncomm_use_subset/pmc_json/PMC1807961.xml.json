In eukaryotes, expression is most often mediated by transcription factors (TFs) that bind upstream of the transcription start site (TSS) and recruit the polymerase assembly (4). TFs bind, with varying affinity, to a set of similar, short (\u223c6\u201320 nt) sequences (5). Computational binding site discovery focuses on finding significantly overrepresented sequences in upstream regions of co-regulated genes (6\u20138). Thus, computational TFBS prediction algorithms must begin with an input set of promoters from genes hypothetically co-regulated by a shared TF. The algorithms aim to predict the binding positions and consequently the nucleotide specificity of the TF (9\u201311).",

Experimental techniques, such as chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) (12), have been successfully used to generate a genome scale mapping of approximate TF-binding positions (10,13,14). Computational techniques, such as phylogenetic profiling (15,16) and artificial neural networks, can also be used to identify sets of co-regulated genes. Both experimental and computational approaches, however, suffer from a significant false positive (FP) prediction rate. Inclusion of extraneous promoters in the input sets dilutes the enrichment of the shared TFBS sequences making computational TFBS discovery significantly more challenging (17). We term such erroneously included promoters decoy sequences (DSs).",

Given a set of input promoters, motif detection algorithms identify a set of short, oligonucleotide segments hypothesized to bind to the TF of interest. The predicted sequences can be used to construct a position weight matrix (PWM) representing the average nucleotide frequencies for each position in the site (19). Ideally, computational detection will return all sequences that bind to every TF with biologically relevant function in those upstream regions. However, since the source of binding specificity for TFs is not well understood (20), heuristic approaches and ad hoc multiple alignment based scoring schemes are used to identify locally optimal solutions (17). Each local optimum that exists in a given set of promoters may correspond to distinctly different motifs, and may score differently relative to each other according to different scoring schemes.",

As a result as few as 10% of predicted positions correspond to biologically functional binding sites (23). Due, in part, to the low accuracy rate, computational binding site identification has been of limited use (23). Problems identifying binding sites are further exacerbated in mammalian genomes by larger promoter regions (24) and scarcity of reliable information on co-regulation of genes. Thus, the most demanding test of efficacy for TFBS identification approaches lies in their application to mammalian systems and subsequent validation of predictions.",

Positional clustering identified a number of putative cis-regulatory sites, many of which correspond to known binding elements for TFs found in the CNS. Mobility shift assays showed several predicted GABR-binding sequences specifically bind nuclear proteins derived from primary neocortical neurons kept in culture. Furthermore, a particular non-consensus GABR putative regulatory sequence was shown to have a functional role in cultured cortical neurons demonstrating the efficacy of positional clustering in detecting functional regulatory elements in mammals.",

Sequence similarity based clustering is impaired by the combination of sequence variation within motifs, the short length of TF-binding sites, and aligning motifs of different lengths. Instead of using sequence based clustering, we chose to cluster results by position, counting the number of times Gibbs sampling identifies each nucleotide in the promoter (Figure 1). We find that Gibbs sampling predictions, generated using BioProspector (8) are power-law distributed over nucleotide position (Supplementary Figure S2). Gibbs sampling converges on the majority of nucleotides very infrequently, and a small number of nucleotides very frequently. Thus, the most frequently recurring nucleotides appear in as few as 10% of results. Moreover, we find the power-law distribution of results is robust to Gibbs sampling algorithm and scoring scheme (data not shown). We can hypothesize that the most frequently occurring positions are the most biologically significant. Thus, discarding the least frequent Gibbs sampling results may yield higher accuracy and robust identification of biologically insignificant positions.",

One type is the identification of an incorrect motif from a set of upstream regions known to bind to a TF of interest as described above (see Methods). The second type of FP error is the background discovery rate of the correct motif using upstream regions that do not bind to the TF. To simulate this rate for STE12-like binding site recovery we repeated the analysis as described above starting with 51 randomly chosen yeast promoters. We find that positional clustering identifies STE12-like sites in <5% of results, compared with 10\u201315% for Gibbs sampling alone. Thus, using positional clustering, the performance of computational motif discovery is enhanced not only by improving the positive predictive value in promoters of genes co-regulated by STE12, but also by decreasing the false discovery of STE12-like sites by \u223c10%.",

Improvement appears to be limited and unreliable only when sampling alone correctly identifies the binding site in fewer than \u223c20% of results.

Positional clustering, as shown above, is more robust to noisy input than Gibbs sampling alone, and thus may be better suited to identify de novo cis-regulatory elements in mammalian promoters that are coordinately regulated. To test this possibility, we chose seven mammalian GABR promoters (GABRps) whose activity is potentially altered in response to status epilepticus as identified through change in mRNA levels of the gene products (31,35). We also included orthologous rodent promoters in the input sets (45). Orthologous promoters were included to provide more instances of binding sites in the input set than would be expected by random, allowing for easier detection of the sites. Inclusion of orthologous promoters has the additional effect of selectively amplifying evolutionarily conserved binding sites. Such binding sites are more likely to have major functional roles in the regulation of the GABR receptor. Thus, sensitivity to such sequences is improved at the expense of sensitivity to species-specific binding sites. With this effect in mind, we require all GABR-binding site predictions to exist in orthologous promoters. Since the mechanisms of co-regulation for the seven GABRs are unknown, hypothetical co-regulation models were evaluated by querying all 27 possible subsets of the seven GABRps. Clustering results on nucleotide positions and selecting the most frequently occurring positions, we predicted 13 functional TF-binding sites.",

We find that the most frequently returned positions better predict TF binding sites than the maximally scoring motifs from Gibbs sampling (Figures 2 and 3). Since scoring functions are empirically derived and do not necessarily represent biological reality, the result is not altogether unexpected (17). However, we find that selecting frequently recurring positions allows filtering of up to 90% of spurious sampling results caused by convergence on biologically uninformative local minima. Positional clustering allows unbiased aggregation of results from different motif widths, thus approximating the width of the binding site \u2018for free\u2019 (54).",

            "text": "Next we show that positional clustering improves robustness to the addition of DSs (Figures 2 and 3). Such sequences arise from inclusion of promoter regions in input sets without direct binding to the TF either due to experimental error or computational mis-annotation (17,22). In the STE12 example studied, linear regression models indicate our approach will maintain an advantage over traditional Gibbs sampling through addition of up to 150% noise to the original signal (Supplementary Figure S4). Empirical data, however, show a sharp decrease in improvement close to the addition of 45 DSs, or roughly double the input set (Figure 2). Moreover, evaluations using promoters co-regulated by other TFs indicate positional clustering is less likely to improve predictions when Gibbs sampling identifies a correct site in <20% of repetitions (Figure 3). Thus, it is possible the rather simplistic linear model overestimates improvement in robustness beyond what is practically achievable. Moreover, when multiple motifs exist in the input promoters, preliminary evidence suggests positional clustering will uniquely identify a single dominant motif (Supplementary Figure S5). With further refinement, however, it may be possible to recover subordinate motifs, enabling identification of cis-regulatory modules. In spite of these limitations, using positional clustering of repeated runs, researchers can successfully apply sampling algorithms in identification of functional binding sites in datasets with a significant proportion of noise.",

Thus, having established increased robustness to DSs in yeast, we applied our approach to identify potentially unknown GABAA receptor subunit gene regulatory sequences that may participate in the response of the genome to seizure activity. We reasoned that GABAA receptor subunit genes either up-regulated or down-regulated in the animal model of epilepsy would share common binding motifs. Using positional clustering, we predicted 13 TF-binding sites upstream of GABAA receptor subunit genes (Table 1). Twelve of our predictions were verified by either comparison to known binding sites or experimental verification using in vitro binding assays. Initially positive experimental results highlight the ability of computational techniques to direct research into transcriptional regulation in mammalian models. As such, our approach may be applicable in the study of other protein complexes in the mammalian proteome.",

Research along these lines may dramatically improve our understanding of GABAA receptor regulation and its role in disease and development.
