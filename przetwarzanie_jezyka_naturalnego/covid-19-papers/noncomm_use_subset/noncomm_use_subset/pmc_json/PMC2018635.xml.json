Pol \u03b2 expression levels are important for the maintenance of genome integrity. On account of its low fidelity, the overexpression of Pol \u03b2, which has been reported in several cancer types, leads to a mutator phenotype associated with genetic instability and decreased sensitivity to anti-cancer chemotherapeutics (3\u20136). Conversely, cells deficient in DNA polymerase \u03b2 display hypersensitvity to alkylating agent-induced apoptosis and chromosomal breakage (7). Sugo et al. (8) have demonstrated that Pol \u03b2-deficient mice die immediately after birth, due to extensive apoptosis in the developing central and peripheral nervous systems. These data indicate that DNA polymerase \u03b2 expression level is extremely important and must be tightly regulated.",

This upregulation requires the presence of the specific cAMP response element (CRE) in the promoter of the Pol \u03b2 gene (9,10). It has also been shown that the Pol \u03b2 promoter contains a binding site for the transcription factor SP1 (11). Although regulation at the transcription level is apparent, expression of the Pol \u03b2 transcripts might also be controlled at the post-transcriptional level. In rat cells there are two alternatively polyadenylated Pol \u03b2 transcripts, with 3\u2032UTRs of significantly different lengths (12). The expression of the two transcripts is tissue specific. The short transcript is present in most tissues, with significantly higher expression in testis, while the long transcript is expressed mostly in the brain and lungs (13). Motifs present in the 3\u2032UTRs of the two transcripts are likely to be responsible for regulation of tissue-specific expression.",

There are several examples of transcripts with similar structures within the 3\u2032UTR, constituting cis-acting regulatory elements, involved in mRNA localization. Structural motifs (hairpins) present within the 3\u2032UTR of c-fos (15), c-myc (16), MT-1 [metallothionein-1, (17)], slow troponin C (18) and vimentin (19) mRNAs have been shown to be involved in targeting these mRNAs to the perinuclear cytoplasm and, presumably, anchoring them in this location by binding to cytoskeletal elements (20). Hairpin elements within the 3\u2032UTRs were also reported to stabilize transcripts by binding factors that protect against nuclease cleavage [e.g. binding of IRP protein to the IRE sequence in the 3\u2032UTR of transferrin receptor mRNA, (21)] and to re-program translation as in the case of the SECIS element which directs an insertion of selenocysteine into in-frame UGA codons (22).",

We describe the identification of a protein factor binding to this motif\u2014Hax-1, an anti-apoptotic, cytoskeleton-related protein, which is known to bind a hairpin structure within the 3\u2032UTR of vimentin mRNA. We demonstrate that binding occurs only for a Hax-1 dimer, though RNA binding is not a prerequisite for the dimerization itself. We confirm the importance of the hairpin structure for binding of Hax-1 by its mutagenic disruption, which impairs the RNA\u2013protein interaction. We also report strong association of Hax-1 with the nuclear matrix, which is a novel finding, consistent with its transcript-binding properties. Taken together, these data suggest that the hairpin element within the Pol \u03b2 3\u2032UTR represents a novel motif important for post-transcriptional regulation of expression.",

            "text": "Probing data demonstrated that the short 3\u2032UTR of Pol \u03b2 transcript forms three separate structural modules, designated M1\u2013M3 (Figure 1B). Module M1 represents a small hairpin structure with a C-rich terminal loop. The 3\u2032-part of this structure is efficiently hydrolyzed with lead ions, even at a low concentration of the probe, which suggests that M1 hairpin has binding capacity for this metal ion. Module M3 contains the polyadenylation signal, followed by the cleavage and polyadenylation site, so only a part of it is present in the mature short Pol \u03b2 transcript, which implies minor importance of the whole M3 module as a post-transcriptional regulatory element. Module M2 is formed by nucleotides located between bases G29 and C96 of the analyzed transcript and is composed of three helical regions, two 6 bp and one 14 bp in length. Each of these helical regions is resistant to enzymatic digestion and lead ion hydrolysis. The three helixes are separated by two asymmetric, internal loops (b and c), which are mapped very well by all probes used. The longest helical region includes as many as six non-WC, U-G and G-U base pairs. Four of these exist as two tandems: U-G, G-U and U-G, U-G, which are known to be potential metal- or protein-binding sites. The hairpin structure contains a small 3-nt terminal loop (5\u2032-UAU), which is also well recognized by both lead ions and enzymes (Figure 1A and B). The M2 hairpin structure is conserved among species (Figure 2), which suggests its significant role in regulation of transcript fate.\n",

A vector bearing the unmodified luciferase gene served as a control (pCMLuc). To asses mRNA levels of the reporter, quantitative PCR was performed for cDNA preparations obtained from cells subjected to the same transfections as for luciferase assays. The results (Figure 4) show a significant decrease of mRNA levels for the construct with the hairpin structure (H), compared with almost unchanged mRNA levels for the mutated hairpin (Hmut). These differences, however, are not reflected at the protein level: both constructs (H and Hmut) caused an increase in luciferase expression, although only for the Hmut is this increase significant. The relative increase of protein levels in respect to mRNA levels is therefore more than 3-fold for the construct with the intact hairpin, while only a slight relative increase (\u223c1.7-fold) was observed for the mutated construct. These changes in expression indicate a complex post-transcriptional regulation in which the hairpin element has a key function.\n",

In the present work, secondary structure analysis by lead ion hydrolysis and enzymatic digestion revealed the existence of several motifs in the analyzed sequence, namely, a region of strong lead ion binding (M1), a hairpin-forming and highly evolutionarily conserved region (designated as M2) and the region containing polyadenylation sequence (M3). Only M2 is evolutionary conserved, the rest of the untranslated region has high interspecies sequence variation, which suggests lesser functional importance.

From these results, we deduce that BH domains (BH1 and BH2) present in the N-terminal part of the protein do not take part in the dimerization. BH domains and a transmembrane domain (present at the C-terminus of Hax-1) represent the features of Bcl-2 family proteins, but there is no significant sequence homology between these proteins and Hax-1 - only a weak, partial homology to pro-apoptotic Nip3 (35).
