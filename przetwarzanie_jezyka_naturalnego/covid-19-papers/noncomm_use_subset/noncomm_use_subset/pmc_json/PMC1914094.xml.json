More recently, an additional concept has emerged: some disulfide bonds operate as dynamic scaffolds capable of regulated rearrangement into a variety of functional forms (Jordan and Gibbins, 2006). Consistent with this notion, various cell surface processes have long been known to depend on catalyzed thiol-disulfide exchange including cell adhesion (Essex, 2004), uptake of bacterial toxins (de Paiva et al, 1993) and viral fusion with the host membrane (Sanders, 2000). Moreover, a variety of cell surface signaling receptors appear to exist in more than one thiol-disulfide configuration, for example CD28 (Greene et al, 1996). However, in most cases, neither the catalyst driving thiol-disulfide exchange nor the functional differences between the redox forms have been elucidated.",

            "text": "A number of thiol-disulfide oxidoreductases are known to be secreted and to act on the cell surface. One of these redox catalysts is protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), a member of the thioredoxin (Trx) superfamily. Cell surface-PDI has been found to act on transmembrane and surface-associated proteins, including the envelope protein of HIV-1, to cause its fusogenic conformation (Markovic et al, 2004) and integrins, to mediate platelet adhesion (Lahav et al, 2003). Another thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase associated with extracellular functions is Trx1. Best known for its intracellular roles, Trx1 reduces transiently formed disulfide bonds of cytosolic and nuclear target proteins and thereby participates in a multitude of fundamental processes, ranging from oxidant scavenging and DNA synthesis to regulation of apoptosis and cell proliferation (Powis and Montfort, 2001). In addition, Trx1 is released to the extracellular environment by a variety of normal and neoplastic cells (Rubartelli et al, 1992). Human Trx1 was first purified as a cytokine-like factor from supernatants of virally transformed lymphocytes and initially named adult T-cell leukemia-derived factor (Tagaya et al, 1988), Tac-inducing factor (Tagaya et al, 1989), B-cell stimulatory factor or \u2018B cell IL-1' (Wakasugi et al, 1990). Extracellular Trx1 is present in the circulation of healthy subjects and its levels increase under inflammatory conditions, including viral infection (Nakamura et al, 2001a). Circulatory Trx1 acts as a chemoattractant for monocytes, neutrophils and lymphocytes (Bertini et al, 1999), and inhibits neutrophil migration into inflammatory sites both in vitro and in vivo (Nakamura et al, 2001b). More recently, Trx1 was found to be secreted by dendritic cells upon cognate T-cell recognition and to contribute to subsequent T-cell activation (Angelini et al, 2002).",

            "text": "At present, the mechanism(s) and pathway(s) by which extracellular Trx1 influences cellular behavior remain unknown. As many of its reported extracellular activities depend on a functional active site, it appears likely that Trx1 catalyzes thiol-disulfide exchange in one or more cell surface target proteins through its enzymatic activity. However, thiol-disulfide exchange reactions, even if highly specific, are too transient to be detected by conventional techniques. To date, only a single cell surface receptor, CD4, a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily, has been shown to be susceptible to Trx1 redox activity (Matthias et al, 2002). Other cell surface proteins targeted by the enzymatic activity of Trx1 await identification.",

Using a kinetic trapping technique that enables the detection and isolation of otherwise short-lived reaction intermediates on the surface of intact cells, we identify and validate the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member CD30 (TNFRSF8) as the principal target molecule for Trx1 on infected and transformed lymphocytes. The cell surface activity of Trx1 is highly selective, discriminating between different members of the TNFR superfamily. Trx1-mediated thiol-disulfide exchange leads to a structural change in the CD30 ectodomain that can be detected with conformation-sensitive antibodies. We demonstrate that disulfide exchange between Trx1 and CD30 interferes with binding of the CD30 ligand (CD30L) to its cognate receptor and that Trx1 affects CD30-dependent changes in lymphocyte effector function. As CD30 is implicated in both stimulatory and apoptotic signaling, our findings suggest that Trx1 interacts with CD30 to modulate lymphocyte behavior and survival under conditions of infection and inflammation.",

To create a trapping mutant, the second cysteine of the 32CXXC35 motif was replaced by serine (C35S). Trx1 harbors three additional cysteine residues distal to the active site (cysteines 62, 69 and 73). As these residues are dispensable for catalytic activity but may cause oxidative inactivation by either intra- or intermolecular disulfide bond formation (Casagrande et al, 2002; Watson et al, 2003), we also created mutants containing amino-acid substitutions for those additional cysteines (Figure 1B; CCCCC, CCAAA, CSCCC, CSAAA and SSAAA annotate the identity of residues 32, 35, 62, 69 and 73).",

Incubation led to the formation of a reproducible pattern of distinct mixed disulfide conjugates as visualized by silver staining of a SDS\u2013PAGE gel under non-reducing conditions (Figure 1C, lane 7). In accordance with the trapping mechanism, conjugation strictly depended on the availability of the N-terminal thiol (Cys-32) and the concurrent absence of the C-terminal thiol (Cys-35), as wild-type or cysteine-free Trx1 did not capture any proteins (Figure 1C, lanes 3, 5 and 9).

The main cytosolic interaction partner of Trx1(CSAAA) was identified as peroxiredoxin-1 (Prx1) by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The Trx1\u2013Prx1 association was further confirmed by immunoblotting (data not shown).

Grx1, like Trx1, uses its active site thiol to act as a disulfide reductase in the cytosolic environment. However, in contrast to Trx1, Grx1 is specialized in the recognition and reduction of protein\u2013glutathione mixed disulfide bonds and forms mixed disulfide intermediates with glutathione rather than with proteins (Yang et al, 1998; Peltoniemi et al, 2006). As expected, we did not detect trapping of peroxiredoxins (or other Trx1-interacting proteins) by Grx1(CSAAA), neither on silver gels (Figure 1E, lanes 3 and 4) nor by immunoblotting (data not shown). The activity and thiol reactivity of the Grx1 trapping mutant was confirmed in independent experiments (data not shown), thus demonstrating that the mere availability of an active site thiol does not explain the profile of proteins captured by the Trx1 trapping mutant. Instead, our results support the notion that Trx-mediated reducing activity is steered toward distinct target disulfide bonds by specific protein\u2013protein interactions.",

Given previous indications of disulfide bond exchange between CD4 and wild-type Trx1 (Matthias et al, 2002), we asked whether kinetic trapping would enable us to detect this interaction on the surface of the CD4 positive promyelocytic cell line U937. In brief, we allowed mutant Trx1 to interact with the surface of live cells, removed unreacted oxidoreductase by washing and collected disulfide-linked Trx1 complexes from cellular lysates by streptavidin (SAv) affinity purification. We found that cell surface CD4 forms a mixed disulfide with exogenously added Trx1(CSAAA) (Supplementary Figure S1, left panel), which could be dissociated by DTT treatment (Supplementary Figure S1, right panel). This result confirmed that kinetic trapping can indeed be used to identify specific Trx1-reactive cell surface proteins and should therefore allow de novo identification of previously unknown cell surface target proteins.",

We therefore applied cell surface trapping to a human EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid B-cell line (LCL-721.220) derived from the same parental cell line (LCL-721) as the 3B6 cell line, originally used in the description of the costimulatory factor \u20183B6-IL1', later identified as Trx1 (Wakasugi et al, 1990). Mixed disulfide complexes, which formed on the surface of LCL-721.220 cells were isolated and analyzed by Trx1-specific immunoblotting to visualize overall mixed disulfide conjugates. Interestingly, we found that Trx1 predominantly engages a single protein on the lymphoblastoid surface, suggesting a highly selective interaction (Figure 2A, lane 3). As expected, the trapping product, a mixed disulfide conjugate of about 160 kDa, was susceptible to reduction (Figure 2A, lane 4). The 160 kDa conjugate did not form on the surface of the EBV-negative Burkitts lymphoma cell line BL-41 (Figure 2B). In contrast, a conjugate of the same size was found to be formed on the surface of CCRF-CEM T cells (Figure 2C) and YT large granular lymphoma cells (data not shown). Pretreatment of the cell surface with the alkylating agent iodoacetamide (IAA) did not interfere with the formation of the 160 kDa mixed disulfide conjugate, thus confirming that the conjugate was formed by the expected disulfide exchange mechanism (rather than by de novo disulfide bond formation between two thiol groups).",

The 160 kDa band was absent in the control precipitation with Trx1(CCAAA). Corresponding bands from non-reducing and reducing lanes were subjected to tryptic digestion and LC-MS/MS analysis. From both samples the unknown protein was identified as TNFRSF8 (CD30), a member of the TNFR superfamily. To validate the direct covalent interaction between Trx1(CSAAA) and CD30, an aliquot of trapped complexes from the same experiment was separated under non-reducing and reducing conditions and subjected to immunoblotting analysis with anti-Trx1 (Figure 3A, middle panel) and anti-CD30 antibodies (Figure 3A, right panel), respectively. The observed mobility difference between non-reducing (NR) and reducing (R) lanes demonstrated the formation of a mixed disulfide conjugate (Figure 3A, right panel). Additional immunoblotting experiments demonstrated that low nanomolar concentrations of Trx1(CSAAA) are sufficient to detect the interaction with CD30 (Figure 3B) and also confirmed that trapping of CD30 depends on the N-terminal cysteine of the CXXC motif (Figure 3C, lanes 1\u20138). Application of the Grx1 trapping mutant under the same conditions did not lead to its conjugation to CD30 (Figure 3C, lanes 9 and 10). Immunoblotting and flow cytometry experiments confirmed that BL-41 cells, unlike the other lymphocytic cell lines, do not express CD30 (Supplementary Figure S2), thus explaining the absence of the 160 kDa conjugate band (Figure 2B).",

To exclude the possibility that Trx1 interacts with CRDs uniformly, we tested whether Trx1 discriminates between distinct members of the TNFR superfamily. As shown in Figure 4A, CD95 (TNFRSF6) did not form a mixed disulfide conjugate with Trx1(CSAAA) on the same cells under identical conditions. The same result was obtained for the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which contains a total of 25 ectodomain disulfide bonds, and is expressed at substantial levels on A431 cells (Gill and Lazar, 1981) (Figure 4B). These findings indicate that Trx1 reactivity of cell surface receptors is selective and is not determined by the presence of CRDs or the number of ectodomain disulfide bonds. To further exclude that Trx1 reactivity of receptors is determined or limited by surface expression levels, we ectopically overexpressed CD30 or other TNFR superfamily members under control of the same promoter in HeLa cells and analyzed Trx1 cell surface trapping by indirect immunofluorescence. While mock-transfected HeLa cells did not capture Trx1(CSAAA) on their surface (Figure 4C, lower row), expression of CD30 led to a strong Trx1 surface association and colocalization of both proteins (Figure 4C, upper row). In contrast, expression of CD95 (Figure 4D), TNFR1 or NGFR (data not shown) did not promote Trx1 interactions with the cell surface, further strengthening the notion that Trx1 reactivity is a specific property of CD30.",

Addition of oxidized Trx1 did not influence antibody reactivity of CD30 (data not shown). When reduced Trx1 was applied in the absence of a regenerating system, a conformational change in CD30 could be observed, but remained incomplete (data not shown). Complete and sustained loss of antibody reactivity required a source of reducing equivalents for the oxidoreductase. Both DTT and Trx reductase (TrxR)/NADPH were found to be effective as regenerating systems. Importantly, neither DTT nor TrxR/NADPH had an effect when applied in the absence of Trx1 (Figure 5A, middle panel and data not shown). Wild-type Grx1 (Figure 5C, left panel) and the redox-inactive mutant of Trx1 (Figure 5C, middle panel) did not alter the redox-sensitive CD30 epitopes. Other cell surface receptors, for example CD28, analyzed in parallel on the same cells were unaffected by Trx1 treatment (Figure 5C, right panel). Loss of CD30 antibody recognition typically occurred within minutes (Figure 5D, upper panel). Testing the influence of Trx1 concentration under the same conditions, consistent effects on CD30 conformation became evident at concentrations around 100 nM (Figure 5D, lower panel).",

When tested experimentally, Trx1 failed to interact with other CRD-containing proteins, including the EGFR featuring a total of 25 ectodomain disulfide bonds. The preference for CD30 could not be explained by exceptional surface expression levels either. While Hodgkin's disease cell lines typically express high levels of CD30, other cell lines including LCL-721.220 or CCRF-CEM show at least 20- to 100-fold lower expression as determined by flow cytometry, yet the same selective targeting was observed. Conversely, ectopic overexpression of several related TNFR superfamily members in HeLa cells did not lead to their interaction with Trx1, yet CD30 strongly interacted on the same cells under the same conditions. Consistent with these findings, recent experiments demonstrate that Trx1 targets a particular site within the CD30 ectodomain (Y Balmer and TP Dick, unpublished data).",

However, plasma Trx1 is oxidized and appears to represent systemic dilution of Trx1 previously released within tissues. Accordingly, local tissue concentrations of secretory Trx1, for example, within activated lymph nodes, are expected to be markedly higher than in plasma. Overall Trx1 concentrations in mammalian tissues can be as high as 20 \u03bcM (Gromer et al, 2004). Certain Trx1-secreting cell types, including macrophages and dendritic cells, distinctly upregulate expression of Trx1 upon activation (Angelini et al, 2002). In vitro studies of Trx1 secretion suggest that a substantial fraction of intracellular Trx1 can be released within a few hours (Rubartelli et al, 1992). Although direct measurements of extracellular Trx1 within tissues are not available, physiologically relevant extracellular Trx1 concentrations may well reach into the upper nanomolar, if not lower micromolar range.",

In vivo activation of CD30 can be monitored by the release of sCD30, shed from the plasma membrane upon CD30L binding (Hansen et al, 2000). Similar to serum Trx1, serum sCD30 is increased in infection, autoimmunity and allergy, for example systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis and atopic dermatitis (Horie and Watanabe, 1998). Both Trx1 and CD30 appear to play a role in the regulation of the antiviral inflammatory response. Both Trx1 secretion and CD30 expression have been associated with virally transformed lymphocytes. Elevated levels of sCD30 occur during viral infection. Likewise, viral infection leads to elevated Trx1 plasma levels and several studies indicate that secreted Trx1 modulates the antiviral inflammatory process (Nakamura et al, 2001b, 2002).",
