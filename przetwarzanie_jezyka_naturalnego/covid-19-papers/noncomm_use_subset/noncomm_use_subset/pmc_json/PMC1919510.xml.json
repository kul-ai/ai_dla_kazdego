            "text": "Screening for genetic changes to unveil molecular attributes of human specimens is important for a variety of medical applications, including genotyping for inherited disorders, prediction of the pathologic behavior of malignancies, identification of cancer biomarkers and can affect treatment decisions for individual patients (1\u20133). For example, mutations in genes like EGFR can profoundly influence chemotherapeutic response in lung cancer (2\u20135) and the response is modulated by mutations in other genes of the same signaling pathway [e.g. K-ras, HER2, ErbB-3 (1,6)]. Therefore there is a need for efficient and high-throughput mutation screening of multiple genes along identified signal transduction pathways in tumor samples. Because a large portion of cancer-causing genetic changes remains unknown and can occur in numerous positions along tumor suppressor genes (e.g. p53, ATM, PTEN) mutation scanning rather than detection of specific mutations is frequently required for molecular cancer profiling.",

            "text": "Sequencing is often considered the gold standard for comprehensive mutation analysis. Multi-capillary electrophoresis, re-sequencing arrays or pyrosequencing provide platforms for highly parallel genetic analysis (7\u201313). However, the expense associated with these techniques is currently high both for instrumentation and for running-costs. Since somatic mutations for most genes are relatively rare events it can be inefficient to scan for mutations using expensive approaches that in several cases provide unnecessary data (14,15). Another issue with direct sequencing or re-sequencing arrays is the difficulty in detecting a small fraction of mutated alleles in the presence of a high excess normal alleles, which is frequently the case with clinical cancer samples (16). As a less expensive alternative, rapid pre-screening methods such as SSCP, DGGE, dHPLC, CCM, CDCE or HR-melting are widely utilized to identify DNA fragments that contain mutations prior to performing full sequencing (14,16\u201320). Enzymatic mutation detection based on mismatch scanning enzymes like MutY, TDG or T4 endonuclease VII for mutation pre-screening has also been employed (21\u201325), albeit with modest success since these enzymes cannot detect all possible mutations and deletions (22) and some of them have substantial activity on homoduplex DNA (16). Recently an enzymatic mutation scanning method based on the Surveyor\u2122 (CELI/II) nuclease (26,27) combined with dHPLC or gel electrophoresis detection was introduced that shows satisfactory selectivity and reliability (1% mutant to wild-type alleles is detectable) while it also identifies all base substitutions and small deletions that are important to cancer (17,28) or to biotechnology and plant genetic applications [TILLING method (29\u201334)]. While reliable, the use of dHPLC for examining Surveyor\u2122-generated DNA fragments is a slow endpoint detection method restricted to examining a single DNA fragment at a time and the resulting DNA fragments cannot be sequenced. This limits analysis of cancer specimens when numerous samples or genetic regions need to be screened.",

            "text": "We introduce a new approach that enables Surveyor\u2122 to scan for mutations over one or several PCR products simultaneously and selectively amplify and isolate the mutation-containing DNA fragment(s) via linker-mediated PCR. By selectively amplifying mutation-containing DNA from wild-type fragments, the present approach de-couples enzymatic mutation scanning from the endpoint detection step. As a result, following enzymatic action on mismatches any chosen DNA detection method (real-time PCR, gel/capillary electrophoresis, microarray-based detection) can potentially be used to identify the mutated DNA fragments in a simplex or multiplex fashion. Here we utilize real-time PCR coupled with melting curve analysis (Surveyor\u2122-mediated Real Time Melting, s-RT-MELT) to validate the new technology. We demonstrate that this approach increases the mutation scanning throughput by 1\u20132 orders of magnitude when several (>100) samples are to be pre-scanned for mutations, enables mutation scanning over several PCR fragments simultaneously and mutation-positive samples can be directly sequenced when somatic mutations are at a low-level (\u223c1\u201310% mutant-to-wild-type ratio) in surgical cancer specimens.",

The percent melting (hypochromicity)-versus-temperature relations for GC-clamp-containing PCR products and Surveyor\u2122 activity-generated products were estimated using the POLAND algorithm (37), and the thermodynamic parameters determined by Blake and Delcourt for 75 mM NaCl in the solution (38) were used.

Figure 2A depicts dHPLC chromatograms of the products obtained using a sample containing a p53 exon 8 G > A mutation or a wild-type sample. The standard Surveyor\u2122-dHPLC approach (28) was first employed to identify the mutation following PCR amplification of exon 8 from genomic DNA. The resulting dHPLC traces contain a single product for the wild-type and two products for the mutation-containing sequences (Figure 2A, curves 1 and 2, respectively). Next, s-RT-MELT was used to screen the same p53 exon 8 sequence. Following PCR amplification with GC/M13-modified primers we cross-hybridized PCR products and exposed them to Surveyor\u2122 and TdT tailing. The subsequent real-time PCR was run at different denaturation temperatures and the products were examined either via dHPLC or via real-time melting-curve analysis. At the standard denaturation temperature of 94\u00b0C the mutation-containing sample contains two peaks, corresponding to the anticipated amplification of both Surveyor\u2122-digested and un-digested fragments (Figure 2A, curve 3). However, when the PCR denaturation temperature is lowered (e.g. 86\u201388\u00b0C) a single PCR product is generated for the mutant sample, while the wild-type sample demonstrates no product (Figure 2A, curves 4\u20137). In Figure 2B, real-time differential melting curves for the PCR reaction run at 88\u00b0C are depicted. A peak corresponding to the PCR product from the mutant sample is again clearly evident, which is absent in the wild-type sample. Finally, Figure 2C depicts sequencing of the s-RT-MELT-generated PCR fragment, as well as the direct sequencing from genomic DNA. The G > A mutation is evident in both samples. In the s-RT-MELT product the anticipated addition of the poly-A tail at the 3\u2032-position next to the mutation is illustrated.\n",

The real-time PCR reaction was again performed at 88\u00b0C and mutant-to wild-type ratios of \u223c1\u201310% were distinguished from the wild-type using either dHPLC (Figure 2D) or melting curve analysis (Figure 2E). In these samples, direct di-deoxy-sequencing could not identify a mutation if the ratio of mutant-to-wild-type was <\u223c30\u201340% (data not shown). On the other hand, sequencing of s-RT-MELT products was possible including the lower dilutions (Figure 2F). sRT-MELT sequencing generated traces with poly-A tails depicting the presence and the position of the mutation, although the exact nucleotide change was less clear than the one in exon 5 (i.e. the position \u00b11 base from the mutation might also be confused to be a mutation). The reason for this \u00b11 base ambiguity of the exact position of the mutation can be probably understood. The PCR performed following poly-A tail addition contains an equimolar mixture of three reverse primers (3\u2032 ending in V = G, A or C). Depending on the exact nucleotide at the mutation, the correct primer should in theory be preferred, while the other two primers should not allow efficient polymerase extension due to the mismatched 3\u2032-end. However, in practice this \u2018allele-specific PCR\u2019 step occasionally allows 3\u2032-mismatched primer extension, enabling more than one version of the primer to amplify over the position of the mutation, or alternatively the incorporation of the poly-A tail may occur \u00b11 base from the exact position of the mutation. We conclude that in certain cases sRT-MELT indicates the position of the mutation to within 1 base, while in others (e.g. p53 exon 5) it indicates the position \u2018and\u2019 the actual nucleotide change.",

            "text": "Next, p53 exon 8 was amplified using DNA from a group of 48 surgical lung adenocarcinoma samples and s-RT-MELT was used for the screening of unknown mutations via melting curve analysis. Mutations at different positions along exon 8 were present in several of these clinical samples, as indicated by the shift in melting profiles obtained (Figure 2H) and subsequently verified via sequencing. In this set of samples, sRT-MELT-sequencing detected a low-level mutation on a colon cancer specimen (CT20) that direct sequencing failed to identify (Figure 2I). As with Figure 2F, sequencing of sample CT20 indicated the position of poly-A tail addition to within one base, but the actual nucleotide change was difficult to identify. To exclude the possibility for a false positive, two independent RFLP-based methods were used to verify the presence of the mutation. Thus, since the position of poly-A tail addition was known (Figure 2I, codon 273 of p53 exon 8) the mismatched primer approach by Behn et al. (42) was used to introduce an MluI restriction site for the wild-type p53 sample but not for the codon 273 mutants. Subsequent restriction with MluI enzyme followed by PCR generated a product with a 14487G > A mutation for the CT20 sample but not for the wild-type sample (Supplementary Figure 1, Frame A). As an additional verification for the low-level CT20 mutation, we observed that G > A mutation generates a de-novo Nla-III site at the position of the mutation. Accordingly, we applied \u2018Amplification via Primer-Ligation At The Mutation\u2019, a method that we described previously (40,41) to ligate a primer at the Nla-III-digested site, and preferentially amplified the mutant fragment in a second PCR. The sequenced PCR product identified again the 14487G > A mutation (Supplementary Figure 1, Frame B). In conclusion, sRT-MELT identified correctly a p53 codon 273 low-level mutation on CT20 that was missed by regular sequencing. This is very significant as p53 exon 8 mutations at codon 273 have been associated with bad prognosis in cancer (43,44).",

To estimate the influence of the GC-clamp length on PCR efficiency versus temperature and the PCR amplification of fragments generated for mutations lying at different positions along the sequence, a calculation based on the POLAND algorithm (37) was performed. The predicted minimum temperatures for substantial PCR amplification were then plotted versus the experimentally observed values. Three possibilities were simulated, no GC-clamp, 26 nucleotides (nt) GC-clamp and 117-nt GC-clamp. DNA fragments corresponding to mutations at several positions along exon 8 were also simulated and compared to the experimentally observed minimum temperatures for generating a PCR product for three samples that contained mutations at different positions along p53 exon 8 (SW480, CT5 and TL50). The results (Figure 2G) indicate agreement to within \u223c1.0\u00b0C between theoretical prediction and experimental observation. For denaturation temperatures in the region 85\u201388\u00b0C in combination with a 26-nt GC-clamp all the available mutations on p53 exon 8 are predicted to result in selective amplification of the mutation-containing fragment and inhibition of the GC-clamp-containing fragment. This prediction is consistent with the experimental results obtained from PCR temperature-titration experiments (Figure 2G). The developed calculation algorithm can thus be used to predict the appropriate PCR denaturation temperature for additional PCR fragment/GC-clamp combinations.",

To demonstrate that s-RT-MELT can be used for parallel scanning of mutations in several PCR products, we mixed equimolar amounts of PCR products from p53 exons 5\u20139 containing mutations either in exon 8 or in exon 9. We then formed \u2018cross-hybridized sequences\u2019 and screened the mixture for mutations in p53 exons 5\u20139 in a single tube using s-RT-MELT, as depicted in Figure 1A. Following real-time PCR and melting curve analysis, the exon 8 or exon 9 mutants were clearly distinguished from the wild-type sample (Figure 4A, curves 1\u20133). Next, the mutant exon 8 DNA sample was first diluted 10-fold into wild-type exon 8 and the equimolar mixture of p53 exons 5\u20139 was prepared and screened again in a single tube via s-RT-MELT. The exon 8 mutation was again distinguished from the wild-type mixture of exons (Figure 4B, curves 1\u20133). Since >80% of p53 mutations in human tumors are encountered in exons 5\u20139 (45), the multiplex single-tube s-RT-MELT reaction could be used to identify most p53 mutations encountered in clinical tumor samples. Combined with multiplex PCR directly from genomic DNA, this approach could result to a convenient, high-throughput method for mutation scanning.\n",

As a proof of principle of the compatibility of s-RT-MELT with OpenArray\u2122, p53 exon 8 PCR products were generated from 48 different lung adenocarcinoma samples and mutation-containing cell lines and processed via the hybridization and enzymatic steps of s-RT-MELT. The 48 samples were each dispensed in 10 replicate nano-liter volume reactions on OpenArray\u2122 plates pre-fabricated to contain the appropriate primers and amplified in 3072 real-time PCR reactions using a denaturation temperature of 90\u00b0C in the presence of SYBR-GREEN I dye. Melting curves were subsequently obtained using the OpenArray\u2122 melting curve analysis mode. The PCR growth curves and smoothed differential melting curves obtained distinguish clearly the mutation-containing samples from wild-type samples (Figure 4C and D, representative results from 3072 reactions). Furthermore, identification of mutation-containing samples is in good agreement between the conventional and the nano-technology platforms (Figure 4D versus Figure 2H). These data indicate that s-RT-MELT is compatible with high-throughput nano-technology detection formats and reiterates the advantage of de-coupling enzymatic selection from the detection step. Comparison of the throughput using conventional pre-screening method (dHPLC or dHPLC/Surveyor\u2122) to s-RT-MELT (Table 1) indicates that s-RT-MELT is 1\u20132 orders of magnitude faster when a large number of samples (>100) are screened for mutations.

Here we enabled Surveyor\u2122, an endonuclease that recognizes selectively mismatches formed by mutations and small deletions following \u2018cross-hybridized sequence\u2019 formation, to generate mutation-specific DNA fragments that are amplified and screened via differential melting curve analysis. The replacement of size-separation methods (capillary/gel electrophoresis, dHPLC) by real-time PCR technology as the endpoint detection platforms and the ability to scan more than one sequences in parallel result in a highly increased throughput for s-RT-MELT while retaining the ability to detect diverse mutations at low-levels.",

For this reason, s-RT-MELT was designed to attach an oligonucleotide linker to the 3\u2032-DNA ends via terminal transferase (TdT) instead of using the 5\u2032-DNA ends. The exonuclease activity also tends to degrade the attached 5\u2032-GC-clamps in s-RT-MELT, thereby eliminating their influence in reducing amplification of un-digested fragments. We found that if exposure of DNA \u2018cross-hybridized sequences\u2019 to Surveyor\u2122 is limited to 15\u201320 min, the substantial degradation of 5\u2032-GC-clamps is avoided. For multiplexing mutation detection using several PCR products simultaneously, the size of the GC-clamp on each PCR amplicon may need to be individually adjusted to ensure that mutations along all sequence positions of the PCR products included in the mixture can be screened at a single real-time PCR temperature and that undigested fragments do not amplify. The calculational tools developed in this work can be used to guide the individual design of GC-clamps. s-RT-MELT detects heterozygous SNPs as well as mutations. As with other mutation pre-screening techniques, the presence of a SNP concurrently with a mutation might be difficult to identify without performing sequencing. Because SNPs occur at fixed positions, melting peaks originating from SNPs have a reproducible pattern and melting temperatures (46,47) thus in many cases they should be distinguishable from mutations. Finally, it is noteworthy that s-RT-MELT is a general methodology that may also be applied to isolate mutations using mismatch-cutting enzymes other than Surveyor\u2122 when enzymes with satisfactory properties for mutation detection become available. Detection platforms other than real-time PCR/melting (e.g. DNA microarray-based) may also be envisioned following enzymatic mutation selection.",

Besides enabling highly increased throughput, multiplexed mutation screening and direct sequencing of the identified mutant DNA fragments, s-RT-MELT also retains the advantages of the Surveyor endonuclease over alternative pre-screening methods, such as reliability and identification of genetic alterations present at low (1\u201310%) fractions in the sample. s-RT-MELT provides a significant advancement in unknown mutation scanning in cancer research and diagnostics as well as for general medical, biological and biotechnology applications.",
