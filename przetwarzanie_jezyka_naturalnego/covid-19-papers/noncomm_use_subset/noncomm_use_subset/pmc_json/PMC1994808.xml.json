The following year, 1985, saw the completion of the 172,000 base pair sequence of the DNA of Epstein-Barr virus, a herpesvirus that infects virtually all humans and causes certain infected individuals to develop Hodgkin\u2019s disease, Burkitt\u2019s lymphoma, or nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Since the sequencing was done manually, this heroic feat required eight postdoctoral scientists working full time for several years.

The Cambridge group also developed \u201cshot-gun\u201d methods for sequencing the genome of Epstein-Barr virus, in which the sequence of random fragments of viral DNA was determined, and the sequences of overlapping DNA segments were then aligned by computer. This method turned out to be essential for solving the sequences of the much larger bacterial and cellular genomes, and eventually the postdoctoral fellows were replaced by robots for the cloning operations and by automated DNA sequencing machines. Our ability to record and analyze long DNA sequences was also sorely tested, a predicament that helped lead to the development of methods of computational analysis required for the study of bacterial and cellular genomes.",

Vaccines based on the major capsid protein of the high-risk human papillomaviruses will prevent much cervical cancer, and the hepatitis B virus surface antigen vaccine already is causing a reduction in the incidence of hepatocellular cancer [14,19]. These cancer vaccines are produced by using recombinant DNA technology with defined viral DNA segments because of the difficulty of propagating these human tumor viruses in the laboratory. These two vaccines alone have the potential to eliminate greater than 10 percent of the world-wide cancer burden. The prevention of cancers by vaccination is the culmination of a century-long effort to tie infectious agents to cancer and validates this entire enterprise [20]. In addition, ongoing work at Yale and elsewhere demonstrates that viral gene expression is required to maintain the survival and growth of certain cancers, suggesting that anti-viral drugs may be useful in treating these cancers once they develop [21,22,23]. Vaccination against viral non-structural antigens expressed by cancer cells also has emerged as a potential therapeutic approach.",

Studies based on this work will have a profound effect on our understanding of these important human pathogens and the genetic basis for future influenza pandemics, but this work also inspired much discussion about the potential misuse of sequence information and scientific knowledge. The very rapid identification of a novel coronavirus as the causative agent of SARS was a stunning achievement based entirely on sequencing [26,27]. Recent sequencing studies also revealed that the environment harbors a vast number of uncharacterized bacteriophage and other viruses [28,29].
