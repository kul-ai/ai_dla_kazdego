These database scans are run with the BLAST (5) engine, which identifies sequence neighbors with significant similarity, and the resulting sequence identifiers and taxonomy indices are stored, so that Entrez can provide \u2018Related Sequences\u2019 links for all protein records in the collection. The \u2018Related Structure\u2019 service is built on top of this system. Sequence neighbors directly linked to MMDB are identified and alignments are re-computed by employing the \u2018BlastTwoSequences\u2019 tool (9) to restore alignment footprints. The \u2018Related Structure\u2019 web interface provides direct access to this information. Initially this service had been restricted to sequences from microbial genomes (10), but it has now been expanded to cover all proteins in Entrez and is updated daily to provide a comprehensive 3D-structure annotation service. Identification of structure-linked neighbors and the visualization of sequence-structure alignment is also possible using Entrez and the Cn3D alignment viewer/editor, but \u2018Related Structures\u2019 provides a convenient new summary and \u2018one click\u2019 shortcuts to 3D visualization. These 3D views may be used to identify conserved residues and map site-specific features derived from the 3D structure. Currently \u223c48% of non-identical protein sequences in Entrez have been linked to at least one related structure, employing a conservative threshold for alignment length (50 aligned residues or more) and similarity (30% or more identical residues in the aligned footprint); see Figure 1 for details.",

Sequence identity is calculated from the BLAST alignments, and here only those neighbor relationships are listed that produce an aligned footprint of 50 residues or more. The analysis also excludes protein sequences which have been directly obtained from MMDB. Forty-eight percent of sequences in Entrez protein have at least one structure neighbor with an extensive alignment footprint and at least 30% identical residues.",
