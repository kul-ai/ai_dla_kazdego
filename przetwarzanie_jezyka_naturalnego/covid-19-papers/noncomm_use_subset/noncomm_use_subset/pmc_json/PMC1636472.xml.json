            "text": "Nucleic acid assays utilizing cleavage enzymes to generate a fluorescent signal from dual-dye-labeled oligonucleotide probes have been extensively used in diagnostics (1\u20133). In these assays, the ability of fluorescent dyes to transfer energy absorbed from light to nearby molecules forms the basis of homogeneous nucleic acid based assays (1,4,5). In the unhybridized state the fluorophore and quencher are within close proximity, which allows the quencher to absorb energy from the fluorophore to affect quenching. The use of fluorogenic probes in a 5\u2032-nuclease polymerase assay, where the probe is enzymatically cleaved to release the fluorophore (2), is well known. The signal amplification reaction utilizes invasive cleavage with structure-specific 5\u2032-nucleases (6). The method requires annealing of two oligonucleotides, called the upstream oligonucleotide and the probe, to a target sequence, which results in the formation of a unique substrate for the 5\u2032-nuclease. In the DNAzyme-PCR strategy the primer contains a target-specific sequence and harbors the antisense sequence of a 10\u201323 DNAzyme. During amplification, amplicons are produced containing active sense copies of DNAzymes that cleave a reporter substrate included in the reaction mixture (7). A target nucleic acid sequence can be amplified exponentially in vitro under isothermal conditions by using three enzymatic activities essential to retroviral replication: reverse transcriptase, RNase H (RNA cleavage) and a DNA-dependent RNA polymerase (8). Cycling probe technology represents a simple method for the detection of DNA target sequences, utilizing a chimeric DNA\u2013RNA\u2013DNA probe which is cleaved by RNase H when hybridized with its complementary target (9).",

If left unrepaired, AP sites are potentially lethal or mutagenic (11). To cope with the deleterious consequences of AP sites, organisms possess AP endonucleases that initiate the repair of these DNA lesions (10). Class II AP endonucleases initiate repair by catalyzing the hydrolysis of the 5\u2032-phosphodiester of an abasic site to generate a 3\u2032-OH group and a 5\u2032-abasic phosphate residue (10). The substrate specificity of human apurinic endonuclease on synthetic substrate analogs has been reported previously (12).",

            "text": "Here we describe a novel endonuclease IV (Endo IV) assay substrate (Figure 1C) that mimics the abasic lesions that normally occur in double-stranded DNA (Figure 1A and B). The first lesion (Figure 1A) is a typical abasic (apurinic or apyrimidinic site generated by spontaneous or enzymatic loss of a nucleic acid base. The second lesion (Figure 1B) is an atypical abasic site appearing as a result of inherent instability of the 3\u2032-phosphodiester bond in abasic deoxyribose in lesion 1 or its cleavage by a Class I AP endonuclease. As shown by the arrow, AP endonucleases cleave the phosphodiester linkage at the abasic sites. In the novel Endo IV assay a short probe with a fluorophore linked through a phosphate at the 3\u2032 end and a short enhancer oligonucleotide generate an artificial, lesion 2 type Endo IV substrate. This arrangement allows the specific and efficient cleavage of the phosphodiester bond of the probe by Endo IV and release of fluorescent dye (Figure 1C). The addition of a quencher at the 5\u2032 end of the probe allows quenching of the fluorescence in the uncleaved probe. The specific cleavage of the phosphate bond and the generation of fluorescence is the basis of the new assay.",

The FMOC-aminohexanoyl modified probe was isolated by reverse-phase HPLC and deprotected by treatment with concentrated ammonium hydroxide for 1 h at room temperature. The deprotected oligonucleotide was further purified by reverse-phase HPLC using the triethylammonium bicarbonate buffer as described above, dried and re-dissolved in 50 \u03bcl of dry DMSO. To this solution, 10 \u03bcmol compound 8c (Scheme 2) and 1 \u03bcl triethylamine were added. After being kept at room temperature for 10 h the reaction was combined with 1 ml of 2% solution of NaClO4 in acetone. The precipitated crude conjugate was further purified by reverse-phase HPLC, dried and re-constituted in 1\u00d7 TE buffer. An additional molar absorbance (\u025b260) of 28 500 M\u22121 cm\u22121 was used in the probe concentration calculation to correct for the presence of the dye.",

Probes I\u2013III demonstrated similar specific cleavage. A 2- to 3-fold decrease in the rate of non-specific cleavage for probes II and III versus probe I was observed. These low, non-specific cleavage rates translate into high-specific to non-specific cleavage ratios. It appears that chloro- or chloro/methyl substitutions in the fluorophores of probes II and III, respectively, are beneficial for the reduction of non-specific cleavage. One possible explanation for this reduction may be an effect of increased hydrophobicity of FL2 and FL3 on enzyme activity. In the case of probe IV, with the extended hydroxyprolinol linker, the rate of specific cleavage almost doubled. However, the corresponding increase in the rate of non-specific cleavage was \u223c20 times higher than that observed in probe III, substantially compromising the ratio of specific to non-specific cleavage rates. Once again, this result implies the existence of inhibiting interactions between Endo IV enzymatic activity and fluorophore which can be adjusted by moving the fluorophore away from the active center.",

A relatively sharp cleavage rate optimum was observed for the probes a, b and c with calculated Tms of 60, 48 and 42, respectively.

As shown in Figure 7, the mismatch signal is often about the same as that of the NTC or slightly higher. The exceptions are the difficult 4-G/T- and 8-T/G-mismatches (24) where match/mismatch ratios of \u223c16 and 7 were observed, respectively. These ratios are quite adequate to differentiate matched and mismatched sequences.

The parameters influencing the activity of the Endo IV enzyme were optimized. This optimized Endo IV detection assay requires, in addition to an oligonucleotide probe substrate, a fluorophore attached through a relatively rigid linker to the oligonucleotide and a helper oligonucleotide. The rigid linker conveys the exquisite specificity of Endo IV cleavage of the phosphodiester linkage in the probe and shows high-specific/non-specific rate ratios. The synthesis of fluorophore analogs coupled to a rigid linker and solid support, used in the synthesis of labeled oligonucleotides, was also disclosed. Excellent mismatch discrimination is observed from positions 1 to 6 in a 12mer probe. The ability to put the mismatch in any one of positions 1\u20136, allows for flexibility in probe design for genotyping assays where sequence and secondary structural constraints are considered. This method allows the use of probes shorter than those typically used in other methods (28) contributing to the improved mismatch discrimination.",
