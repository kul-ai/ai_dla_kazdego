      "text" : "Requirements for eukaryotic ribosomal frameshifting include a shift-prone sequence at the decoding site and often a downstream secondary structure in mRNA. The majority of −1 programmed frameshift sites consist of a heptanucleotide sequence X XXY YYZ [where X can be A, G, C or U; Y can be A or U; and Z can be any nucleotide (6)]. In this configuration, the P- and A-site tRNAs can re-pair with at least 2 out of 3 nt when shifted 1 nt towards the 5′ end of the mRNA. Similarly, for +1 frameshift sites, the identity of the codons in the P- and A-sites of the ribosome is critical for efficient frameshifting. One factor affecting +1 frameshift efficiency is the initial stability of the P-site tRNA–mRNA interaction in the 0 frame (7). High-efficiency frameshifting occurs when the P-site tRNA does not form standard codon–anticodon interactions (8). In some studies, a correlation between +1 frameshift efficiency and the final stability of the P-site tRNA–mRNA interaction in the +1 frame has been shown previously (9,10). However, in other systems there appears to be little correlation (11). In addition, competition between decoding of the 0 frame and +1 frame codons in the A-site may affect frameshifting efficiency (7). Slow to decode 0 frame codons such as stop codons or those decoded by low abundance tRNAs favor frameshifting, as do +1 frame codons with high levels of corresponding cognate tRNAs (12–16).",

      "text" : "High levels of frameshifting are often achieved by the stimulatory action of a cis-acting element located downstream of the shift site. A wide variety of structures, most commonly H-type pseudoknots (17), have been identified which stimulate −1 frameshifting in eukaryotes [for reviews see (18,19)]. Mutagenic and structural data for several of the frameshift stimulators have demonstrated that each pseudoknot has key structural features required for frameshift stimulation (20–28). However, unifying structural feature essential for frameshifting has not yet been identified. This observation combined with recent reports that simple antisense oligonucleotides can functionally mimic cis-acting 3′ stimulators of −1 frameshifting (29,30) demonstrates that many different structures can stimulate frameshifting. Although it should be noted that not all structures of equal thermodynamic stability can stimulate frameshifting (Discussion).",

      "text" : "RNA pseudoknots have also been shown to stimulate programmed +1 frameshifting in many eukaryotic antizyme genes (31,32). Antizyme is a negative regulator of cellular polyamine levels through its ability to target ornithine decarboxylase (the rate-limiting enzyme in polyamine biosynthesis) for degradation (33–35), inhibits polyamine import (36,37) and stimulates export (38). Antizyme expression is induced by high-intracellular polyamine levels, and decreased with lowered levels. The polyamine sensor is a programmed +1 frameshift event that is required for antizyme synthesis. At low polyamine levels, termination at the end of open reading frame 1 (ORF1) is efficient, whereas at high levels of polyamines, a substantial proportion of ribosomes shift to the +1 reading frame and then resume standard decoding to synthesize the full-length and active antizyme protein. Frameshifting at the mammalian antizyme mRNA shift site, UCC UGA, is stimulated by two cis-acting signals (39,40). One of these, the 5′ element, encompasses ∼50 bases upstream of shift site and is important for the polyamine effect (39–41). The other cis-acting element is a pseudoknot located 3′ of the shift site. The mammalian antizyme pseudoknot and a structurally distinct counterpart in a subset of invertebrate antizyme mRNAs (31) are the only pseudoknots known to act as stimulators for +1 frameshifting in eukaryotes.",

Naturally occurring pseudoknots or stem–loop stimulators of −1 frameshifting typically begin ∼6–9 nt downstream of the A-site codon of the shift site (18), whereas +1 frameshift pseudoknots are located closer with only a 2–3 nt separation from the A-site codon (31).

No −1 frameshift product was observed when the wild-type antizyme cassette was examined in the absence of antisense oligonucleotide addition (Figure 2; AZwt).

To address this, a new construct p2luc-AZ1-0sp (Figure 1A) was made by deleting the 3 nt spacer between the pseudoknot and the shift site of p2luc-AZ1wt. In this case, the wild-type pseudoknot is directly 3′ adjacent to the shift site. The products of in vitro transcription and translation were separated by SDS–PAGE.

Construct p2luc-AZ1PKm1 contains sequences from the 5′ half of the axis formed by the stacking of stem 1 and stem 2 of the pseudoknot (Figure 1A). Two complementary 2′-O-Methyl antisense oligonucleotides were designed. First, PKm1 has perfect complimentarity to the region starting 3 nt and ending 21 nt downstream of the UGA shift site codon. Second, PKm2 is the same except that a mispaired C and bulged A were located at positions 9 and 16, respectively. These two alterations were included to more closely mimic the natural pseudoknot which also contains a mispaired C and bulged A at equivalent positions along the extended stem formed by the stacking of pseudoknot stems 1 and 2 (Figure 1; compare p2luc-AZ1wt with the duplex formed between p2luc-PKm1 and antisense oligonucleotide PKm2).

Most models invoke a pausing mechanism whereby the ribosome is paused over the shift site such that time is allowed for the tRNAs to reposition in the new reading frame. This explanation is clearly too simplistic as stem–loops and pseudoknots of similar thermodynamic stability that cause ribosome pausing are not necessarily effective frameshift stimulators (47–49). In addition, variations of the IBV pseudoknot have demonstrated a lack of correlation between the extent of pausing and the efficiency of frameshifting (47). A recent publication by Brierley and co-workers (50) presents structural data demonstrating that the IBV frameshift stimulating pseudoknot blocks the mRNA entrance tunnel and leads to a structural deformation of the P-site tRNA. The resulting movement of the tRNA displaces the anticodon loop towards the 3′ end of the mRNA. A model is presented in which this movement results in disruption of the codon–anticodon interactions, thus allowing for tRNA slippage relative to the mRNA. Similar tRNA movements were not observed with non-frameshift stimulating stem–loop structures. This model provides a feasible mechanistic explanation for the ability of some downstream structures to induce frameshifting.",

Our results indicate that maximal frameshifting is induced when the antisense–mRNA duplex begins 3 nt downstream of the UGA of the shift site, in agreement with the distance found between the UGA of the shift site and the beginning of stem 1 of the pseudoknot stimulator found in antizyme genes. Given this distance, the implication is that the stimulatory secondary structure would be encountered by the ribosome when the UCC codon enters the A-site of the ribosome. Perhaps as suggested by the structural studies of the IBV-1 frameshift inducing pseudoknot, the codon–anticodon interactions between the UCC codon and Ser-tRNASer are disrupted during translocation to the P-site. Given the importance of the UGA codon during frameshifting at the UCC UGA shift site, subsequent events following translocation of the UCC codon to the P-site and UGA to the A-site must influence frameshifting efficiency. This latter event most probably involves competition between termination and +1 frame decoding when the UGA codon is in the A-site. Various discussions have been presented for the importance of A-site and P-site events during ribosomal frameshifting (7,52) and clearly, further investigations of this topic are warranted.",

S1 and S2 refer to stem 1 and stem 2 of the RNA pseudoknot. L1 and L2 refer to loops 1 and 2 of the pseudoknot. Fluc and Rluc represent Firefly and Renilla luciferase genes, respectively. (B) Sequence of the shift site and downstream sequences for dual luciferase constructs and their complementary antisense oligonucleotide partners. Fluc and Rluc represent Firefly and Renilla luciferase genes, respectively.",
