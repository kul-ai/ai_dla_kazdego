            "text": "RNA pseudoknots play an important role in many biological processes. They build the catalytic core of some ribozymes (1,2) and are an important building block of many structural RNAs. Pseudoknots are involved in telomerase activity (3) and they stimulate efficient programmed -1 ribosomal frameshifting (-1 PRF), a mechanism used by a wide range of RNA viruses to encode two proteins within one genomic region. In a recent study (4) over a thousand of potential -1 PRF signals were detected in the yeast genome. The majority of signals however seem to direct the ribosome to premature termination codons. This suggests a mechanism of post-transcriptional gene regulation through the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay pathway. Further genome wide studies have to elucidate this phenomenon. This and many more applications require fast RNA folding algorithms, that are also capable of folding pseudoknots.",

While the standard methods need time proportional to the cube of the input sequence length, pseudoknot prediction is much more demanding. This issue has attracted a large body of bio-informatics work, where all approaches either abandon the model of free energy minimization, or make restrictions on the class of pseudoknots that can be recognized. The well-known algorithm by Rivas and Eddy (7), which is able to predict a restricted class of pseudoknots, needs O(n6) time and O(n4) memory space, where n is the sequence length. Even more restrictive, but more efficient by two orders of magnitude is the program pknotsRG by Reeder and Giegerich (8), requiring O(n4) time and O(n2) space. The new method presented here re-implements and extends this approach in several significant ways.",

Input has to be provided in a FASTA format containing one single RNA sequence. All non-nucleotide characters (i.e not A,C,G,T,U,N in upper or lower case) are removed from the sequence. The nucleotide \u2018T\u2019 is treated as \u2018U\u2019 during the folding routine, \u2018N's are always unpaired. The user selects one of the three basic modes and optionally an energy threshold for suboptimal enumeration. If he wants to use the window mode, at least the window size has to be specified. The default window increment is set to one, unless otherwise specified. Depending on the user selection, there are three different ways how the result is displayed:\nMFE structure only: The computed secondary structure and its energy are displayed in Vienna (Dot-Bracket) Notation. Here, a pair of opening and closing parenthesis denotes a base pair, a dot represents a single stranded nucleotide. A 2D visualization is generated using the PseudoViewer Web service (10). Also, a link to a Connect formatted file, originally used by Michael Zukers mfold (11), is provided. An example output is shown in Figure 1.\nSuboptimal solutions: The list of suboptimal solutions is displayed as an RNAmovie (12). RNAmovies displays the individual suboptimal structures one after another with an adjustable number of intermediate transition steps. This allows for a smooth morphing from one structure to the next. Additionally, all suboptimal structures are displayed as Vienna strings along with their respective energy value at the bottom of the result page.Window mode: For each window, the start and end position is displayed, followed by the result of the window folding. This may be one structure (as Vienna string), or many if the suboptimal mode is also selected. There is currently no vizualization provided, when using the window mode. However, the user can resubmit the sequence of an interesting window on its own. Then, the vizualizations explained in (i) and (ii) are automatically generated.",

They consist of only two helices, interacting in a crosswise fashion, as shown in Figure 2.

Since only two helices participate in one pseudoknot, we loop over all possible knots in one O(n4) loop and store the result in a two-dimensional matrix. More detailed, for a pseudoknot between bases i and j, the algorithm enumerates all k and l, such that i < k < l < j. The first pseudoknot helix (a in Figure 2) starts at base pair i and l, the second (b) at position k and j. Now, we make use of our canonization: The maximal length of a helix can be pre-computed and stored in a two-dimensional array. Therefore, after choosing position k and l, the algorithm looks up the maximal helix lengths, h for (i, l) and h\u2032 for (k, j) and checks the applicability of Rule 3. Having the stems fixed, the location of the three enclosed pseudoknot loops (u,v,w in\nFigure 2) follows directly: loop u ranges from position i + h + 1 to k\u22121, loop v from k + h\u2032+1 to l\u2212h\u22121, and loop w from l + 1 to j\u2212h\u2032\u22121. The best folding for these smaller subsequences has already been computed earlier in the DP scheme. The energy sum of the two pseudoknot helices and the loop folding energies gives us the total pseudoknot energy. The minimal one over all k and l, is stored is the two-dimensional pseudoknot matrix. This value competes with values of unknotted foldings for the interval (i, j).",
