In the INSDC database, each virus genome is registered in a single flat file if the virus does not have segments. If the virus genome has two or more segments, each segment is registered in a single flat file. Complete genome/segment data were identified by the description in the definition line of the flat file. We extracted genome records with the words \u2018complete genome\u2019 and without the words \u2018Third Party Annotation (TPA)\u2019 or \u2018nearly complete\u2019 in the definition line of the flat file.

These records were obtained from the virus division or the phage division of the DDBJ database. We extracted and stored 18 418 complete virus genome/segment data sets from release 66, which was the latest DDBJ data released at the time of the initial development of GIB-V (Table 1).
