            "text": "RNA viruses, including coronaviruses, encode a group of structural phosphoproteins with basic patches on their surface. As a pivotal structural component of the virion, this group of proteins plays essential roles in packaging the RNA genome to form a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex resulting from assembly of the viral RNA and multiple copies of the (nucleo)capsid protein. A detailed dissection and characterization of the intrinsic RNA-binding properties of these proteins are thus essential for understanding several important processes in the life cycle of RNA viruses, including assembly of the nucleocapsid, the specific encapsidation of viral RNA and morphogenesis of virions. In this study, amino acid residues in the N-terminal domain of the nucleocapsid (N) protein of a coronavirus that are critical for its RNA-binding activity are identified and their roles in viral infectivity are analyzed, using site-directed mutagenesis based on our previous structural studies.",

            "text": "Coronaviruses are enveloped viruses containing the largest known single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome of \u223c30 kb (1). During the coronavirus life cycle, the N protein is synthesized in large amounts and is thought to play an important role by specifically packaging the viral genome into a filamentous nucleocapsid of \u223c10 to 15 nm in diameter and several 100 nm in length, a macromolecular structure that is visible by using electron microscopy (2). In addition to its structural role, the N protein also participates in viral RNA transcription, replication and in modulating the metabolism of host cells (3\u201313). Using X-ray crystallography techniques, we recently determined a 3D structure of the N protein from coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), a prototype coronavirus, and showed that the basic building block for nucleocapsid assembly was a dimer of the N protein (14). The 409 amino acids long IBV N protein is composed of two globular domains that are resistant to proteolysis. Amino acids 29 to 160 form the N-terminal RNA binding domain and residues 218 to 329 form its C-terminal dimerization domain (5,14). Even though the structure of the N-terminal domain was determined in the absence of a nucleic acid ligand, its overall shape and the distribution of electrostatic charges suggest a plausible model for RNA binding. The outer surface of the N-terminal domain is enriched in aromatic and basic residues, a common feature for RNA-binding proteins (15). The shape of this domain is reminiscent of a hand having basic fingers, a hydrophobic palm and an acidic \u2018wrist\u2019. The positively charged \u2018fingers-like\u2019 \u03b2-hairpin extension could neutralize the phosphate groups emanating from RNA, whilst the base moieties could make contact with exposed aromatic residues from the hydrophobic palm (14).",

We used purified recombinant wild type and mutant proteins containing the N-terminal domain expressed in Escherichia coli for RNA binding assays. These studies led to the identification of a number of amino acid residues essential for the RNA-binding activity of the domain. Subsequently, we introduced mutations that either severely or mildly impair the RNA binding activities of the N-terminal domain into an infectious cDNA clone system derived from the genomic RNA of IBV to assess their effects on viral replication and infectivity. We identified several residues exposed to the solvent whose substitutions to alanine yield a decrease of RNA binding and a concomitant reduction in virus replication. Interestingly, residues Arg-76 and Tyr-94, located at the base of the positively charged flexible hairpin loop and on the hydrophobic platform, respectively, were critical for RNA binding and viral infectivity.",

Positively charged lysine and arginine residues in the N-terminal domain of SARS-CoV N protein were proposed to bind a 32 nt stem\u2013loop structure located at the 3\u2032 end of the SARS-CoV RNA genome (18). Indeed, the structure of this domain possesses some features reminiscent of RNA-binding proteins sharing the RNP fold (19\u201322). These RNA-binding proteins, including the U1A spliceosomal protein (23) and the coat protein from MS2 bacteriophage (24), bind the RNA ligand with residues emanating from the surface of a four-stranded anti-parallel \u03b2 sheet. Presumably, strands \u03b22 and \u03b23 as well as the flexible \u03b2-hairpin from the IBV nucleocapsid protein could fulfill a similar role by interacting with phosphate groups from an RNA ligand (Figure 1). The \u03b23 strand is the longest in the N-terminal domain of IBV N protein and several evolutionarily conserved residues project from it (Figure 1).

To more vigorously test this model, systematic mutagenesis of residues essential for the RNA-binding activity was carried out. We targeted the exposed hydrophobic residues Tyr-92 and Tyr-94 (strand \u03b23) that could form stacking interactions with the nucleotide bases as well as several basic or polar residues emanating from the \u03b2-hairpin (Figure 2a). As summarized in Figure 2a, 10 amino acids were mutated to alanine. These residues are either exposed to the solvent (Gln-74, Arg-76, Lys-78, Lys-81, Tyr-92 and Tyr-94) or have been conserved during evolution (Tyr-70 and Arg-73) and are thus likely to be involved in RNA binding or to play an undefined functional role. In addition, mutation of Asp-111 to an alanine was included as an additional control for the RNA-binding assay (Figure 2a).",

Approximately equal amounts of the purified proteins were separated on SDS\u2013PAGE (Figure 2b, upper panels). After transfer to a Hybond C extra membrane, the RNA-binding activities of wild type and mutant proteins were analyzed by northwestern blot with two probes corresponding to the positive- and negative-sense 3\u2032-UTR of IBV, respectively. A moderate decrease in binding to both the positive and negative sense RNA probes was consistently observed with most mutant proteins, and representative gels are shown in Figure 2b (Figure 2b, middle and lower panels). Among all mutants, mutation of Tyr-94 to an alanine residue showed the most significant reduction in binding of the domain to both positive and negative probes. The RNA binding activities of this mutant to positive and negative probes were reduced to 27 and 25%, respectively, of the wild type were observed (Figure 2b, lane 9). Relatively less reduction in the RNA-binding activity was observed for the R76A, K78A, K81A and Y92A mutant proteins which retain between 50\u201374% of the wild-type binding activity (Figure 2b, lanes 5\u20138). With the exception of the Q74A and D111A mutants, which displayed a slight increase in the RNA binding activity to both the positive- and negative-sense RNAs, (Figure 2b, lanes 4 and 10), all other mutants showed a certain degree of reduction in their binding activity to either RNA probes (Figure 2b). As a control, a circular dichroism analysis of the two corresponding R76A and Y94A single mutants was performed to check whether the mutant proteins were properly folded. The spectra obtained for these two mutants were similar to the wild-type protein, ruling out any drastic conformational change introduced by the mutations (data not shown).",

Mutations of both Arg-76 and Tyr-94 (R76/Y94A) to alanine reduced the RNA-binding to the positive- and negative-sense RNA probes to only 7 and 19% of wild-type, respectively (Figure 2b, lanes 15 and 16). Taken together, these results are consistent with the presence of an extended RNA binding site covering a large part of the accessible surface of the N-terminal domain of the coronavirus N protein. They are also in agreement with the assumption that removal of a single positive charge at the protein surface by mutation of a lysine or arginine residue to an alanine is insufficient to totally disrupt the formation of the protein\u2013RNA complex.",

In previous structural studies of the N protein from two coronaviruses, the N-terminal domain was shown to be resistant to proteolysis and to fold independently (14,15). It serves as a functional unit critical for the RNA-binding activity of the protein (14). Based on these structural results, the importance of individual residues in RNA-binding was studied. Here we showed that Tyr-94 in strand \u03b23 binds to the RNA ligand. The positively charged Arg-76 is located in the immediate vicinity of this aromatic residue at the base of the extended flexible hairpin loop, within a cluster of positively charged residues. Thus, the interaction between Arg-76 and Tyr-94 with RNA appears to play a crucial role during virus assembly. Since no single mutation could totally disrupt nucleic acid binding, other aromatic or basic residues located close to these two residues at the surface of the N-terminal domain are likely to contribute to RNA binding by creating a broad surface that makes contact with the genomic RNA. Using a simple docking experiment, the RNA binding site seems capable of accommodating up to 8\u20139 nt bases per N-terminal domain monomer. The Arg-76 and Tyr-94 residues identified in this paper thus provide more precise mapping of the location of the RNA-binding site on the IBV N protein.",

However, the replication of negative strand RNA is nearly normal in cells transfected with these mutant constructs. Is it possible that these mutations will directly impair an undefined function of the N protein that is essential for subgenomic RNA transcription? Two possibilities were considered. First, the coronavirus N protein is directly involved in subgenomic RNA replication. The MHV N protein was shown to be involved in coronaviral RNA transcription (4), but the underlying mechanism was unrevealed. Alternatively, the observed phenotypic changes in subgenomic RNA replication caused by these mutations may be due to a generally reduced viral replication rate and infectivity. In fact, several other mutations that affect viral replication cycles were found to have defects in subgenomic RNA transcription (25\u201327). In this study, we have repeatedly observed that detection of subgenomic RNA replication in cells infected with low multiplicity of infectivity of IBV by RT\u2013PCR is technically challenging. Positive results can be obtained only if transcription of subgenomic RNA reaches a certainly high level. When in vitro transcripts containing Y92A mutation were introduced into cells, one or two CPEs were always observable in a monolayer, suggesting the presence of low level viral RNA replication. However, detection of subgenomic RNA was consistently unsuccessful in cells electroporated with this mutant transcript.",

The mechanism for this trans-effect is currently unknown. In this study, the R76A and Y94A mutant N constructs could promote rescue of the infectivity of the in vitro synthesized IBV RNA as efficiently as did the wild type N transcripts, suggesting that the reduced RNA-binding activity in the N-terminal domain does not affect this function of the N protein.

The nice correlation between the reduced RNA-binding activity of the N-terminal domain from the mutant proteins and the loss of infectivity of the corresponding mutant transcripts would support that the failure to rescue the viral infectivity is due to the specific mutation that impairs the functionality of the N protein. In addition, in the cases of Q74A and R76A mutants, the two mutations are physically adjacent in the genome, but yet totally different phenotypes were observed from the two mutants. It would support that the failure to recover infectious viruses from the mutant transcripts is due to the fact that these mutations reduce/impair the RNA-binding activity of the N protein. If this were the case, however, supplement of wild type N protein in trans would rescue the infectivity of the mutant transcripts. Two experiments were conducted to test this possibility, but none of them were successful. First, co-transfection of the mutant full-length transcripts with wild-type N transcripts into cells failed to recover infectious virus from the mutant transcripts, suggesting that wild-type N RNA cannot rescue the infectivity of the mutant transcripts in trans. The second experiment was to introduce the mutant full-length transcripts into cells stably expressing a six-His-tagged IBV N protein. Once again, it failed to rescue the infectivity of the mutant transcripts. At present, it is unclear if this was due to the low-level expression of N protein in these cells or because the N protein expressed in these cells contains the six-His tag at its C-terminus.",

It is possible that introduction of similar alanine mutations into the SARS-CoV genome may yield a similar phenotype observed here for IBV. The fact that substitutions of Gln-74, Arg-76, Tyr-72 and Tyr-94 in the IBV genome by using an infectious clone of IBV showed nice correlation between the RNA-binding activity and viral infectivity would suggest potential strategies for intervention of viral replication. A compound which could specifically bind to this region of the N protein might interfere with RNA binding and thus inhibit virus replication.

            "text": "Figure 5: Analysis of the growth properties of wild type and Q74A mutant virus. (a) Plague sizes and one-step growth curves of rIBV and Q74A mutant viruses. Monolayers of Vero cells on a 6-well plate were infected with 100 \u00b5l of 1-, 10- and 100-fold diluted virus stock and cultured in the presence of 0.5% carboxymethy cellulose at 37\u00b0C for 3 days. The cells were fixed and stained with 0.1% toluidine. To determine the one-step growth curves of wild-type recombinant IBV and Q74A mutant viruses, Vero cells were infected with wild type and Q74A mutant viruses, and harvested at 0, 8, 12, 16, 24, 36 and 48 h post-inoculation, respectively, and viral stocks were prepared by freezing/thawing of the cells three times. The viral titer was determined by plaque assay on Vero cells. (b) Northern blot analysis of the genomic and subgenomic RNAs in cells infected with wild type and Q74A mutant viruses. Ten micrograms of total RNA extracted from Vero cells infected with rIBV and Q74A mutant viruses (passage 3 and 5), respectively, were separated on 1% agarose gel and transferred to a Hybond N+ membrane. Viral RNAs were probed with a Dig-labelled DNA probe corresponding to the 3-end 680 nt of the IBV genome. Total RNA extracted from mock-infected cells was included as negative control. Numbers on the left indicate nucleotides in kilobase and numbers on the right indicate the genomic and subgenomic RNA species of IBV. (c) Western blot analysis of viral protein expression in cells infected with wild type and Q74A mutant viruses. Vero cells infected with wild type recombinant IBV (lanes 1\u20137) and Q74A mutant virus (lanes 8\u201314) were harvested at 0, 8, 16, 24, 36 and 48 h postinfection, respectively, lysates prepared and separated on SDS-10% polyacrylamide gel. The expression of S and N proteins was analyzed by western blot with polyclonal anti-S and anti-N antibodies, respectively. The same membrane was also probed with anti-actin antibody as a loading control. Numbers on the left indicate molecular masses in kilodaltons. (d) Nucleotide sequencing of Q74A mutant virus. Total RNA was prepared from Vero cells infected with passage 5 of the Q74A mutant virus and the region covering the Q74A (CAA\u2192GCA) mutation was amplified by RT\u2013PCR and sequenced by automated nucleotide sequencing. A 30 nt region flanking the CAA\u2192GCA mutation is shown.",
