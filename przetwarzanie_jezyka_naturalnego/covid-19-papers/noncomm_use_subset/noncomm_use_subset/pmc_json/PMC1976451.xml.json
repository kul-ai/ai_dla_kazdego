For their potential to be realized, however, the AOs must be effectively delivered to cell nuclei. Cationic lipoplex- or PEI-based transfection methods used to deliver charged AOs are not suitable for the delivery of uncharged AOs such as phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMO, Figure 1) (1) and peptide nucleic acids (PNAs) (2). Conjugation of PMO to short CPPs is a good method to enhance the cytoplasmic and nuclear delivery of PMO because the conjugates are simple to use and because the short peptides and their AO conjugates can be easily manufactured and characterized in a quality-controlled manner. Examples of well-studied CPP\u2212PMO conjugates include those with Tat and oligoarginine peptides (3,4)\n",

We have reported that Tat and oligoarginine peptides are not stable in human serum (5), and are therefore ill-suited for in vivo applications. Oligoarginine peptides incorporating non-\u03b1 amino acids have been proven superior to oligoarginine alone. CPPs containing 6-aminohexanoic acid (X) and \u03b2-alanine (B) were more stable in human serum than Tat or oligoarginine peptides (5). A CPP\u2212PMO conjugate, (RXR)4\u2212PMO, has been shown to be more efficient in the correction of pre-mRNA mis-splicing (6) and in inhibition of the replication of mouse hepatitis virus in vivo (7) than an oligoarginine peptide. In addition, (RXR)4\u2212PMO conjugates have been shown to cause effective exon skipping in muscle cells from DMD dogs (8), in human muscle explants (9) and in mdx mice (10), as well as inhibiting the replication of various viruses in cell cultures (7,11\u201313) and in mice (7,13).",

In pursuit of CPPs with improved characteristics, we have carried out a structure\u2013activity relationship study to investigate the effects of unnatural amino acid insertions in oligoarginine peptides on cellular delivery, nuclear antisense activity, toxicity and serum-binding characteristics of the resulting CPP\u2212PMO conjugates. The unnatural amino acids studied here are X, B and D-arginine (r). We chose to study the X amino acid based on the successes of the (RXR)4 CPP in several studies as shown in the previous paragraph. B and r amino acids were chosen because they have good enzymatic stability (5). The CPPs are (i) the oligoarginine sequences, R8 and R9, (ii) sequences with RXR, RX and RB repeats, as well as various combinations thereof, and (iii) sequences containing D-arginine, r8, (rX)8 (rXR)4, (rXr)4 and (rB)8. The CPP\u2212PMO conjugates were evaluated for their relative (a) cellular uptake, as determined by flow cytometry, (b) antisense activity, as determined by a splice correction assay (13) and (c) cellular toxicity, as determined by MTT cell viability, propidium iodide membrane integrity and hemolysis assays, as well as by microscopic imaging.",

Synthesis of PMO, described previously (15,16), and the CPPs, using standard Fmoc chemistry (17), were performed at AVI BioPharma, achieving purities of >90% as determined by HPLC and mass spectrometry analysis. Conjugation of a CPP to a PMO through an amide linker, described previously (6), was followed with an additional purification step to remove nonconjugated peptide. Samples were loaded on source 30S resin (Amersham Biosciences, Pittsburgh, PA) in a 2 ml Biorad (Hercules, CA) MT2 column at 2 ml/min with running buffer A (20 mM Na2HPO4, 25% acetonitrile, pH 7.0) and purified into 45-s fractions with 0\u201335% buffer gradient (buffer B: 1.5M NaCl, 20 mM Na2HPO4, 25% acetonitrile, pH 7.0) over 60 min, using a Biorad BioLogic low pressure chromatography system.

PI can only permeate unhealthy/damaged membranes, so positive PI fluorescence indicates compromised cell membranes. Only (RXR)4\u2212 and (RX)8\u2212PMO conjugates were found to significantly affect membrane integrity at higher concentrations (up to 60 \u00b5M tested). Figure 8A shows the histograms of pLuc705 cells treated with (RXR)4\u2212PMO at 60 \u00b5M for 0.5, 5 and 24 h. The PI positive (PI+) region was defined by the cells permeabilized with ethanol (positive control) as indicated by the gate in the histogram. The PI histogram shifts from the PI-negative region to PI-positive region in the longer incubations, indicating the conjugate caused membrane leakage in a time-dependent manner. The 0.5- and 5-h-treatments caused a slight shift towards the PI+ region, while the 24-htreatment produced a distinct peak which corresponded to 57% of cells that were in the PI+ region. Figure 8B shows the histograms of cells treated with (RXR)4\u2212PMO at concentrations of 2, 10, 20, 40 and 60 \u00b5M for 24 h. There was no significant PI uptake at concentrations up to 20 \u03bcM. At higher concentrations, the PI+ population appeared and the percentage of PI+ cells increased as the treatment concentration increased, indicating that there were more leaking cells at the higher treatment concentration. Similar concentration- and time-dependent PI uptake profiles were observed for (RX)8\u2212PMO but not for (RB)8\u2212PMO and the remaining conjugates (data not shown). Addition of 10% serum to the treatment medium significantly reduced membrane toxicity for the (RXR)4\u2212 (Figure 8C) and (RX)8 \u2212PMO conjugates (data not shown).\n",

We have found that cell surface proteoglycans were involved with binding of the Tat\u2212, R9F2\u2212 and (RXR)4\u2212PMO conjugates with the (RXR)4 conjugate having the lowest binding affinity. Insertion of X into an oligoarginine CPP reduces the charge density and may lead to decreased binding affinity for proteoglycans. Despite the lower cellular uptake of X/B-containing CPP\u2013PMO, they generated higher antisense activities in the cell nucleus than oligoarginine\u2212PMO. We have found that endocytosis was the internalization mechanism (at least primarily) for oligoarginine- and (RXR)4\u2212PMO conjugates. Indication of different uptake mechanisms was not found among these conjugates (6). Therefore we hypothesize that X/B-containing conjugates have a greater ability to escape from endosomes/lysosomes than oligoarginine conjugates by a mechanism as yet to be studied.",

However, these conjugates were toxic to cells at higher concentrations, which may be a concern when considering potential applications for in vivo delivery of PMO. Replacement of all 8 Xs with Bs decreased both toxicity and antisense activity. The combination of 3\u20134 Xs with several B residues yielded CPPs with no detectable toxicity, and at some concentrations several of them had similar antisense activity as (RX)8\u2212PMO. We think this type of CPP, having Bs and fewer than 5 Xs, will offer balanced activity and low toxicity as well as the stability, and have considerable potential for delivery of therapeutic AOs.

Our observation is different from the results reported by others (20,21) who found that D-CPPs had higher cellular uptake than L-CPPs, although no biological functional cargo was used in their study. The difference between results may be due to the type and size of cargos and the cell lines used for the assays.

It is apparent that these two conjugates caused little immediate membrane damage with 0.5 or 5 h treatment at concentrations as high as 60 \u03bcM (Figure 8). However, these two conjugates had dose-dependent toxicity with 24 hr treatment as shown by the leaky cell membranes and fewer cells compared to controls (Figure 6C&D, Figure 8). Interestingly, the replacement of Xs with Bs in (RX)8\u2212PMO abolished the toxicity, and the replacement of L-arginine with D-arginine reduced the toxicity of (RX)8\u2212PMO (Figure 6). We have found that (rX)8\u2212PMO was completely stable and the peptide portion of (RB)8\u2212PMO was only partially degraded, whereas the peptide portion of (RX)8\u2212PMO was completely degraded in cells (5). We wondered whether the difference in toxicity among (RX)8, (RB)8 and (rX)8\u2212PMO conjugates was caused by differences in intracellular stability, resulting in the metabolized products of (RX)8\u2212PMO producing toxicity. The identifiable metabolized products of (RX)8\u2212PMO were XRXB\u2212PMO and XB\u2212PMO (5) but neither product had any detectable toxicity as measured by MTT assay (data not shown). It is possible that the CPP portion was degraded into free amino acids and/or smaller peptide fragments which were toxic. However, our investigation revealed that neither free R nor X, alone or in combination, caused cellular toxicity. Another possibility is that because of the high hydrophobicity of X compared to B, X in combination with positively charged arginine residues leads to toxicity not generated by B residue combinations. However, this explanation does not account for the difference in toxicity observed between (RX)8\u2212PMO and (rX)8\u2212PMO, which have the same hydrophobicity. Perhaps the toxicity of (RXR)4\u2212PMO and (RX)8\u2212PMO was caused by the peptide fragments that we could not identify by mass spectrometry.",
